编程挑战说明:
NAV is the Net Assets Valuation which is the value of the total assets held in a portfolio. Often the portfolio managers try to track a certain benchmark portfolio in terms of the percentage weight of the assets. For instance, consider a portfolio PORT with 3 assets and a benchmark portfolio BENCH with 3 assets:

    PORT                    BENCH
Stock   Qty   Price     Stock     Qty     Price
AXN     10      10        AXN     50      10
BGT     20      30        BGT     30      30
CXZ     10      30        DFG     30      20
The percentage Nav in stock A for PORT can be calculated as follows:

Nav(PORT) = (Qty(AXN) * Price(AXN))+(Qty(BGT) * Price(BGT))+(Qty(CXZ) * Price(CXZ))

%Nav  = (Qty(AXN) * Price(AXN)) * 100 / Nav(PORT)
A Portfolio is said to be overweight in a stock if its %Nav in that stock is larger than the %Nav in the stock in the Benchmark. Alternately, it is underweight in a stock if its %Nav in a stock is less than the benchmark.

Write a program to calculate the difference in the %Nav of the holdings in the PORT and the BENCH.

Sort the portfolios in alphabetical order and display the difference upto 2 decimal points.
